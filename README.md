A Crossplane testing framework that leverages `crossplane render` and `crossplane beta validate` commands to test if Compositions render correctly against Claims or XRs, and if the rendered manifests validate against their schemas.

## Features

- **Version Agnostic**: Works with any Crossplane CLI version and supports any Composition and Function implementation
- **Local Testing**: Runs entirely locally with no running Kubernetes cluster required. Only requires a running Docker daemon for Composition Functions
- **Multiple Input Types**: Supports both XR (Composite Resource) and Claim inputs
- **XR Patching**: Apply patches on the inputs
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic content using Go template syntax
- **Hooks Support**: Pre-test and post-test shell command execution
- **Assertions**: Validate rendered resources with declarative assertions (count, existence, field checks)
- **Test Chaining**: Export testcase outputs as artifacts for use in follow-up tests to better emulate the reconciliation process
- **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration into any system or pipeline

## FAQ

#### Why was xprin created?

To bridge the testing gap between function-level testing and full e2e testing: you can run render and validate locally with real Compositions and Functions, without a live cluster or real resource creation.
It was originally developed by Elastic, where it is currently being used for mock/integration testing of a [large infrastructure](https://www.elastic.co/blog/journey-to-build-elastic-cloud-serverless).

#### What are typical use cases?

- **Composition testing**: Run `crossplane render` using various combinations of XRs/Claims, Compositions and Functions, and assert on the output.
- **Schema validation**: Validate various combinations of (mock or production) manifests with CRDs via `crossplane beta validate`.
- **Reconciliation emulation**: Chain tests with exported artifacts so later tests consume prior outputs (e.g. observed resources, status).
- **Advanced render inputs**: Drive render with extra resources, observed resources, additional context, environment configs, in multiple tests run one after the other.
- **Upgrades**: Validate upgrades of Crossplane itself, providers, functions before or after adoption.

#### Can I test using my production XRs/Claims or data?

Yes. xprin runs entirely locally in a mock environment. It does not create or modify real resources; it only runs `crossplane render` and `crossplane beta validate` on the inputs you provide, so you can safely point at production data.

#### What is the purpose of patching?

To extend coverage, by creating as many test cases we need without having to provide testdata for each one of them.

#### How does it look like?

#### What does “xprin” mean?

Crossplane + [πριν](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BD), before Crossplane! ([backstory](https://github.com/crossplane/org/issues/103#issuecomment-3493403731))

## How it works

When xprin runs a test case, it follows this specific sequence:

1. **Setup** - Set up environment, expand paths, collect inputs, and copy them to a temporary directory for patching
2. **Pre-test Hooks** - Execute any pre-test hooks defined in the test case
3. **Convert Claim to XR** (optional) - If using a Claim input, convert it to XR using `xprin-helpers convert-claim-to-xr`
4. **Patch XR** (optional) - Apply patches (XRD defaults, connection secrets) using `xprin-helpers patch-xr`
5. **Crossplane Render** - Run `crossplane render` with the XR, Composition, and Functions
6. **Crossplane Validate** (optional) - If CRDs are provided, run `crossplane beta validate` on the rendered output
7. **Assertions** (optional) - Validate rendered resources using declarative assertions (count, existence, field type/value checks)
8. **Post-test Hooks** - Execute any post-test hooks defined in the test case
9. **Export Artifacts** (optional) - If test case has an `id`, copy outputs to artifacts directory for cross-test references

```

For the full flow with decision points and optional steps, see [How It Works](docs/how-it-works.md).

The flow ensures that:
- Pre-test hooks can set up the environment, patch inputs or validate them before processing
- Claims are automatically converted to XRs for compatibility with `crossplane render`
- XRs can be enhanced with defaults and connection secrets before rendering
- The rendered output is validated against schemas if CRDs are available
- Assertions validate rendered resources declaratively (count, existence, field checks) after validation
- Post-test hooks can clean up and perform additional validation after assertions
- Test outputs can be exported as artifacts (when `id` is set) and referenced by later tests via `.Tests.{test-id}` template variables for test chaining
